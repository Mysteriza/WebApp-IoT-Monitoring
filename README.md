# IoT Monitoring - Indoor & Outdoor Weather Dashboard

![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/Mysteriza/WebApp-IoT-Monitoring)

A real-time, web-based monitoring system featuring a dual-tab interface for **Indoor** and **Outdoor** conditions. The indoor dashboard displays temperature, humidity, and gas levels from an ESP8266 (with BME280 & MQ-135 sensors) integrated with Blynk. The outdoor dashboard fetches and displays live weather data from the **BMKG (Indonesian Agency for Meteorology, Climatology, and Geophysics)**.

This dashboard provides a futuristic UI with a glass effect for a comprehensive monitoring experience.
