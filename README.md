# IoT Monitoring - Temperature, Humidity & Gas (MQ-135 Sensor)

![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/Mysteriza/WebApp-IoT-Monitoring)

A simple real-time web-based monitoring system for temperature, humidity, and gas levels, collected from an ESP8266 with a DHT22 and MQ-135 sensor, integrated with Blynk. This dashboard provides a futuristic UI with a glass effect for monitoring room conditions, now enhanced with outdoor weather data from BMKG API.

## Features
- **Real-Time Monitoring üì°**: Displays indoor temperature, humidity, raw gas, compensated gas, and air quality status in real-time, along with outdoor temperature, humidity, and weather conditions.
- **Dynamic Colors üé®**: Colors change based on temperature, humidity, and air quality levels for easy interpretation.
- **Responsive Design üì±**: Works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- **Last Updated Timestamp ‚è±**: Shows the exact last refresh time (including seconds) for both indoor and outdoor data.
- **Manual Refresh Button üîÑ**: Instantly fetch new data with a single click for indoor and outdoor sections.
- **Tabbed Interface with Icons üåûüè†**: Switch between Indoor and Outdoor tabs with intuitive icons for a better user experience.
- **Smooth UI Animations ‚ú®**: Uses CSS transitions for a better user experience.
- **Glass Effect UI ü™û**: Futuristic glass cards with blur effects for a modern look.
- **Optimized API Usage ‚ö°**: Weather data updates are throttled to prevent excessive API calls, respecting BMKG's 60 requests per hour limit.
